# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

This project was created for an internet retail company to be able to store, organize, and update product information using a database.

## Usage

Here is a short [video demonstration](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/H7NnxtDMozu4y5XQ7GB7) using Insomnia to show what this project can do. This project only provides the backend. It must now be integrated into another application to be fully functional. User may clone this backend code from my [GitHub repository](https://github.io/jnc444xd/e-commerce-backend).
